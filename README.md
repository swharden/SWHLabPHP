# SWHLabPHP
SWHLabPHP is a cross-platform PHP-centric scientific project browser, providing a web front-end to easily explore electrophysiology and microscopy project folders residing on a local network. This software was written with emphasis on ABF files and microscopy file formats (fluorescent micrographs, time series, 3d stacks, etc) but can be easily modified to allow browing of other file formats. The intended use of this software is to allow quick browsing of data served on the local network in real time as experiments are being performed.
